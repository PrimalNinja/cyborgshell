OHCJS brings the retro charm of home computers to modern devices, allowing you to create, code, and collaborate anywhere, anytime. With OHCJS, you can:

- Create an account and login on multiple devices
- Code in JavaScript, alone or in teams
- Store your programs in personalized "spaces"

Inspired by the simplicity of 8-bit home computers, OHCJS aims to recreate the instant-on, fuss-free experience of classic computing. Register, login, and start coding in seconds!

In OHCJS, your "space" is your own private storage area, accessible only to you. You can also explore the public space, where you can create, share, and experiment with others.

Sharing is a key feature in OHCJS. Just like swapping floppy disks in the 80s, you can share your space with others, and vice versa. This simple sharing model enables various scenarios:

- Teaching: Share spaces with students for guided learning
- Teamwork: Collaborate on projects in shared team spaces
- Friendship: Mutually share spaces with trusted friends

A live Environment based on OHCJS is located at http://8bitology.com/.

Instructions and Deployment

Read the instructions in the help folder.

To deploy, simply place the lot into your web root folder if the World doesn't have access to it.  If you do want to host it for the World, then move the help, home, public and users folders outside of the webroot somewhere it is not accessible and edit the $strDataRoot within inc-env.php.

If you need to update the About, Terms & Conditions, Privacy and Etiquitte help files, do so also.
