Welcome to CyborgShell!

CyborgShell brings the retro charm of home computers to modern devices, allowing you to create, code, and collaborate anywhere, anytime. With CyborgShell, you can:

- Create an account and login on multiple devices
- Code in JavaScript, alone or in teams
- Store your programs in personalized "spaces"

Inspired by the simplicity of 8-bit home computers, CyborgShell aims to recreate the instant-on, fuss-free experience of classic computing. Register, login, and start coding in seconds!

In CyborgShell, your "space" is your own private storage area, accessible only to you. You can also explore the public space, where you can create, share, and experiment with others.

Sharing is a key feature in CyborgShell. Just like swapping floppy disks in the 80s, you can share your space with others, and vice versa. This simple sharing model enables various scenarios:

- Teaching: Share spaces with students for guided learning
- Teamwork: Collaborate on projects in shared team spaces
- Friendship: Mutually share spaces with trusted friends

CyborgShell [github.com/PrimalNinja/cyborgshell] is released under the MIT software license, because "sharing is caring."
