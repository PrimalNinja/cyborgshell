Roadmap

Here is an overview of some upcoming features we plan to add to this product keeping simplicity as the main goal. Not necessarily in the order they will be available: 

	The ability to create packages, deploy packages, share plackages either publically or to nominated shares.
	
	Additions to the file commands to facilite copying and moving files between spaces and packages.
	
	Some device and key management functions (deleting them).

	Version control. The ability to list versions, load previous versions, rollback to previous versions.
	
	The ability to develop and enhance this product using itself.
	
	Some AI facilities, not only LLM integration but perhaps integration with our dAIbolical product.
	
	Ongoing API development so you don't have to do everything from scratch.

	Auto-execution of a program upon login, with optional bypassing this for if something goes wrong.
	
	Sourcecode 'flavour' support so you can work with different types of files intelligently, such as edit your binary files with the line editor. 
	
	More tools to make teaching software development as simple as it was in the 80s.
	
	Some other suprises.
