Roadmap

Här är en översikt över några kommande funktioner som vi planerar att lägga till i denna produkt med enkelhet som huvudmål. Inte nödvändigtvis i den ordning de kommer att bli tillgängliga:

    The ability to create packages, deploy packages, share packages either publicly or to nominated shares.
    
    Additions to the file commands to facilitate copying and moving files between spaces and packages.
    
    Some device and key management functions (deleting them).
    
    Version control. The ability to list versions, load previous versions, rollback to previous versions.
    
    The ability to develop and enhance this product using itself.
    
    Some AI facilities, not only LLM integration but perhaps integration with our dAIbolical product.
    
    Ongoing API development so you don't have to do everything from scratch.
    
    Auto-execution of a program upon login, with optional bypassing this for if something goes wrong.
    
    Sourcecode 'flavour' support so you can work with different types of files intelligently, such as edit your binary files with the line editor.
    
    More tools to make teaching software development as simple as it was in the 80s.
    
    Some other surprises.
